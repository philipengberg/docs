## Spot prices incl. charges
There are two overall approaches to get electricity prices including all charges.

1. **Address lookup** - Using a free text address query to look up charges (98% accuracy)
2. **Eloverblik** - Using end-user MitID to get household official charges (100% accuracy)

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Address lookup">
    The easiest way to get prices including charges. 
    
    This process consists of **2** steps:

    <Steps>
    <Step title="Search addresses" icon="magnifying-glass" iconType="solid">
    When the end-user has authorized access, you should display the list of addresses associated with the given user, so that they can select which address to get data from.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Get prices for address" icon="chart-simple" iconType="solid">
    You can now request electricity prices incl. all current and applicable charges.
    </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Tip>This approach does *not* guarantee the same degree of accuracy of charges as with the **Eloverblik** approach.</Tip>

    ### Search address
    In order to get prices including charges you first need to get a valid address to make the lookup with.

    ```javascript
    GET /prices/suggestions?address={query}
    ```

            "": "11",
            "zipCode": "2630"
            "city": "Taastrup",
